                <p class="content__text"><p>In a small township of Ngwelezane by the northern coast of KwaZulu-Natal, lived a young girl in a large family. 
                    Nana was what they called her, as she was the baby of the family. Nana lived with her grandmother, mother, two aunts, one uncle and her 5 cousins in a small 3 bedroom house.</p>
                <p>The adults tried their best to provide for the kids but money for new clothes was hard to come by. Nana’s oldest cousin would get new clothes when they could buy, 
                    lucky as she may have seemed, she was to keep those clothes in the best condition for as long as she could fit in them. 
                    This responsibility was emphasised to Nana’s older cousin as the clothes that were new to her were destined for a long journey down the line until Nana, 
                    the final stop, was big enough to fit in them. </p>
            </div>

        <div class="content">
            <h2 class="heading1" data-splitting data-effect2><span class="font-2">So, on the</span><span class="font-2">cycle went</span></h2>
        </div>
        
        <div class="content">
            <p>from the moment her little feet were tightly fastened with her older cousin’s baby shoes when she took her first few steps, <br>
                this was what Nana’s life was, a life of handmedowns.<br>
                For Nana, her biggest wish was to trade places with her older cousin so she could get the new clothes! ,<br>
                She had no idea what that responsibility entailed, <br>
                but time was soon to make her wish come true.<br>
                As Nana got older, so did her cousins who, one by one, <br>
                they began leaving the house for work or school and younger cousins were born. <br>
                <br>
                The cycle went on, with Nana at the top of the line this time and all the responsibility on her shoulders, <br>
                but she loved the bond it had created between her and her older cousins <br>
                and the bond she was beginning to forge with her younger ones<br>

                <p class="content__text"> <p>This was where Nana began seeing the clothes as more than just garments to wear but can be part of someone’s story.
                When Nana became ready to leave the nest and join the “real world”, 
                    she quickly realised that things are quite different, particularly people’s relationship with their clothes.
                In Nana’s new world, her peers would buy clothes by 
                the week only to wear them once and toss them 
                and the fashion brands were producing clothes at a volume that 
                demanded this type of consumerism and unethical labour practices in a new trend called “fast fashion”.
                In the midst of all this, Nana found a new way to tell a story through her clothes</p>
